# 42 C Programming Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of projects developed in the C programming language, as part of my journey through the 42 coding school curriculum. Each project is designed to tackle different aspects of C programming, from basic concepts to advanced programming techniques.

## Projects List

Below is a list of projects included in this repository, each with a brief description and a link to its dedicated sub-directory or external repository.

### Project 1: Libft
- **Description**: The "Libft" project is my first project at 42 coding school. The goal was to recreate several standard C library functions as well as some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program. This project helped me understand the importance of low-level programming and gave me the opportunity to deeply understand the functions that are often taken for granted.
- **Technologies Used**: C programming language.
